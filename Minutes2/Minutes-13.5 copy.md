### **Meeting Minutes 13/5**

**Attendees:**
All team members were present.

**Summary:**
Team members provided updates on their ongoing tasks, with progress made in sensor testing, hardware integration, and system communication. Key activities are outlined below:

---

**Aryan**

* The magnetometer has arrived.
* Brought functional test code to the lab, and conducted performance tests using various magnet sizes and well depths.
* This is the appropriate hardware for our task.

**Noah**

* Continued refining motor actuation.
* Began integrating a trimpot to control motor angles dynamically.

**Steven**

* Began 3D printing prototype troughs using different design variations.
* Aiming to determine the most effective structure for in-game mechanics.

**Joshua**

* Began exploring UART communication between microcontrollers on the main board.
* Held discussions around system architecture and division of control between the boards.

**James**

* Investigated cabling options for the magnetometer to maintain reliable IÂ²C communication over extended distances.
* Researched the use of both non-shielded and shielded cables, including techniques for splicing shielding into the ground connection to improve signal integrity.
