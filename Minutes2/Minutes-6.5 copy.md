### **Meeting Minutes 6/5**

**Attendees:**
All team members were present.

**Summary:**
Progress updates were provided by each team member based on their assigned tasks. Key findings and next steps are outlined below:

---

**Aryan**

* Presented completed test code for the magnetic encoder.
* Binary output was functional when placed near a strong magnet but ineffective at range and lacked analog sensitivity.
* This sensing method was deemed suboptimal for the project.
* Awaiting delivery of the magnetometer ordered from Temu.

**Noah**

* Demonstrated completed code successfully actuating six servo motors using a single microcontroller.
* Code is stable and ready for integration into the broader system.

**Steven**

* Tested a coiled copper wire around a ferromagnetic rod using an oscilloscope.
* Explored the feasibility of magnetic detection via this method.
* Results were inconsistent and difficult to interpret due to limited theoretical resources on custom coil and ferro rod design.

**Joshua**

* Successfully gained control of six touch pads simultaneously.
* Touch pad inputs are providing binary output to the microcontrollerâ€™s LEDs and are ready for system integration.

**James**

* Completed dimension drawings for the game board layout.
* Produced version 1 of the well design, including a trapdoor mechanism with an integrated motor placed underneath to conserve space.
